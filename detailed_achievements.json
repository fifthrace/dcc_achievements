They made it that way because you crawlers are always blowing up whole towns and submerging cities in water or burying entire populations of innocent NPCs with the guts of giant turkeys.\nWhen a temple is desecrated, the shrine's protection fades over several hours. Eventually, it's able to be destroyed, but only with a direct attack.\nYou're supposed to find desecrated temples and destroy the shrines. Hell, it's a sacrament in some religions. But you can't just do it willy-nilly. And certainly not when you're not a member of that congregation. It's like walking into a random ICU from off the street and pulling the plug on someone's braindead grandma.\nIt's not your place.\nGods don't like it when some punk walks into their house and kicks them when they're already down.
