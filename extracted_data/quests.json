    "description": "New Quest. The Fools Who Broke the Glass. \nTHIS IS A GROUP QUEST. All Crawlers currently within the 45 square kilometer blast radius will receive this quest. \nYour party has been designated Host of this Group Quest. As hosts, you will not be allowed to opt-out from this quest. \nWhat the hell is going on? Am I glad you asked! \nA while back a certain NPC started casting a very powerful spell, a spell so potent, that it had to be completed by a future generation. \nHere\u2019s the thing with old spells. They\u2019re like trees. They grow. They get big. Sometimes huge. Bad shit happens when they get screwed up. The bigger the spell, the badder the shit. And boy was this spell big. Not gonna lie. Your favorite AI was looking forward to it going off. \nOh well. This will be almost as good. \nShit is about to go down. For example, you may have noticed every Skyfowl and Chickadee NPC in the area has fallen ill. Most of them have already plunged into a coma, or death. It\u2019s not their fault, but they were tied to the spell, and that\u2019s just the way it is. \nJust like it\u2019s not your fault that you happen to be within 45 kilometers of the fallout from this failed spell. Again, not your fault. (Well, unless you\u2019re Crawlers Carl, Princess Donut, or Katia Grim. Then it\u2019s your fault.) That\u2019s just the way it is. Sucks to be you. \nThere\u2019s going to be an explosion. The epicenter of the blast is marked on your map. Every crawler within the designated blast area is fucked. \nThe object of this quest is simple. Unfuck yourself. Don\u2019t die. \nWarning : This is an event quest. If you do not wish to participate in this quest, you will have sixty seconds from the end of this message to get yourselves into a saferoom. After that, all access to saferooms within the quest zone will be shut off until the event quest is concluded. All NPCs who remain indoors, saferoom or not, will remain safe. All mobs and neighborhood-level boss monsters within the blast radius subject to both physical and magical explosions will be killed. \nReward : All participants who survive will receive a Platinum Quest Box. \nOh, by the way. The explosion is coming in seven minutes. \nRun.",

His health is going down. \nHis death will be the fault of all of you.

Good luck getting to a stairwell if that happens. \nIf the puppy survives the lightning storm and escapes the sharks, odds are pretty good you\u2019ll die anyway.

Emberus, god of fire and ash seems to believe his son\u2019s missing puppy is inside of bubble 18. The dog is not, in fact, within that bubble. He\u2019s just outside of 543, having been recently rescued from a painful death. The next step should be easy. You just gotta bring the two together. Once that happens, both Emberus and Orthrus will immediately return to the Celestial Halls and everything will be almost back to normal. \nIf something happens to the pup, you will fail this quest.

    "description": "New Quest. The Creeping Apocalypse. \nThis is a world quest! All crawlers and all hunters currently active on the sixth floor will receive this quest! \nYou may not opt out of this quest. \nMiriam Dom the vampire has fallen. With the rising of today\u2019s sun, she found herself caught out in the open. Helpless and crying, she burned away into dust. The callous crawlers Carl and Princess Donut watched and did nothing as she died in agonizing pain. Nothing! \n(Actually, not nothing. Someone should probably ask Carl why he suddenly has three new points to his intelligence stat. Suspicious!) \nAnyway, Miriam did not go quietly into the good night. Oh no. Her death has cured thousands of crawlers, monsters, and hunters who have been touched by the vampirism curse. \nThere is, however, a problem. \nSome of the forest monsters infected with vampirism have spent the past few nights on a killing spree. And another vampire, a now-cured Allosaurus by the name of Big Tina, unfortunately has expended a lot of effort on building an army of undead monstrosities using the... leftovers... from the forest-wide slaughter. \nThese newly created monsters are not vampires, and they were not cured when Miriam died. These mindless freaks were left all alone, not under control from any entity. Some are nothing more than mini-Grinders, also known as Shrillings, also known as Shambling Berserkers. We\u2019ve all seen these before, most notably in some of the train stations at the end of the fourth floor. Yes, they can get pretty big and annoying, but it\u2019s not anything you really need to worry about. Hardly worth a regular quest, let alone a world one. You\u2019d have to be a total idiot to let one of those things kill you, especially during the day. I\u2019m looking at you, Nihit Kumar who\u2019s about two seconds from getting... Oh, that\u2019s a shame. Gross. \nAnyway, some of the other, more powerful monsters have become something else, and short of a god, they are the most powerful monsters who have ever set foot on a sixth floor in Dungeon Crawler World history. \nI like to call them Odious Creepers. \nThe good news? Like Shambling Berserkers, Odious Creepers tend to be pretty slow during the day. The bad news? When it\u2019s dark outside, they gain the ability to combine with both Shamblers and other Creepers and get even stronger. And they can get fast, very fast. They can replicate themselves, too, if they have the parts! \nThere are currently fifty of these things... growing around... the forest, plus another few thousand Shambling Berserkers of various sizes. For fun, we have randomized their location. And for extra fun, we have marked the location of each creeper on the map for you all. \nSo, here\u2019s the quest part. Kill all the Odious Creepers before the sun sets tonight. \nFor every Creeper you kill, you will receive +5 to a random stat. For every five you kill, you will receive an additional +5 levels. The crawler or hunter who kills the most will get an additional prize. \nOnly the person who does the most damage gets credit for the kill. \nIf you don\u2019t kill all of them before the sun sets tonight, bad stuff will happen. And I mean every single one of the fifty Creepers. And by bad stuff, I mean something completely batshit. And not just to the crawlers, but the hunters, too. So all of you cowards sitting on your ass in Zockau need to get to work.",

They are nothing better than selfish, wild animals, reminiscent of those creatures who crawl over each other to purchase televisions on Black Friday each year.

The reclusive, pure-blooded mage rarely ventures from her chambers deep in the impenetrable high elf castle.

Destroy the stranglehold the high elves have on the Hunting Grounds. Only then will the daughter find her revenge. \nFair warning. This one won\u2019t be nearly as easy as the last. \nReward : Upon killing Queen Imogen, the contents of the High Elf Castle will become available to loot.

Her kingdom, once flourishing and beautiful, has become marred by infighting and a sloppy revolution that cut off the head of the government and left the body flailing. \nSignet has returned and wishes to reclaim her mother\u2019s crown. Or at the very least, put a proper government in place. In order to do that, she must assassinate the current leaders of the Naiad Confederacy, who are holed up in their fortress at the former river palace of the Naiad, now dubbed \u201cFort Freedom.\u201d \nHelp Signet assault Fort Freedom and establish revenge against her mother\u2019s assassination. \nReward : You get to move on to part two. In addition, every survivor of the assault against the Confederacy will be 20% more willing to follow your orders. I bet that number will go up even more if you complete the second half of this quest.",

    "description": "New Quest. Hell Comes to Crawler Town. \nWar is Hell. \nFor days now, the battles between the Monk Seals and the Red Man\u00edseros Land Crabs have reached a fevered pitch. The sneak attack of the crabs was stopped in its tracks thanks to crawler Sister Ines Quiteria warning the Seals of the treachery, but that warning has come with a terrible price. Instead of a quick attack and surrender, it has become a war of attrition, with both sides losing devastating numbers in only a matter of days. \nThe sea runs red and blue. The corpses pile high upon the beach. The very children both parties were trying to save have suffered, and by this point, the only hope of survival from either side is for them to completely wipe out their enemy. \nThat\u2019s how it is, is it not? When there is war, so often an armistice is nothing more than a delay. A job left undone. An overdue bill for those down the road to eventually pay, and pay with interest. \nWar is Hell. \nAnd hell, my child, hell is not just a place. It is a contagion. It is a virus. It spreads. \nBut worst of all, it attracts . \nSo much death has bombarded the underworld, those who notice such things have taken a special interest in this battle, in this war, in this minor annihilation of two species fighting for their very existence. \nThis happens from time to time. Gods and demons lifting their heads. Oftentimes, that\u2019s as far as it goes. A notice. An interest piqued. \nThis, I\u2019m starting to learn, happens out there, too. But that\u2019s for another day. \nSo much has happened here. Previously-forgotten gods have risen. That alone has caused a great amount of consternation. But there is more. The great prison, the Nothing, has been breached, and not for the first time. This is also concerning, especially amongst those who banished the harem there in the first place. All across the land, gods and demons are being involuntarily summoned from their halls to walk the land. Some of the gods are acting strange. They are acting in ways they should not. \nYes, yes. Both Demons and Gods are paying attention now. Real attention. \nThis usually happens here in the dungeon, but only upon the battlefields outside Larracos, where the Semeru Dwarves built their castle along the roots of the All Tree, seeking the very gods who disdain them. \nIt has never happened this early, this soon. \nWar is Hell... \nAnd Hell really wants to come play. \nWhich is unfortunate, considering some dumbass recently dumped a bunch of highly-contagious, fast-spreading zombie farm animals into an ocean that connects everything. \nFun fact. Most demons can\u2019t just enter the world. They need a weakened shell to inhabit. Something like a new corpse is difficult for them. But if it\u2019s a zombie... \n... \nYou no longer need to choose a side between the Crabs and the Seals because both sides are fucked. They just don\u2019t know it yet. You just need to not die. Get down the stairs without being involuntarily dragged into hell. That\u2019s how you win this quest. \nReward : You will receive a Legendary Quest Box. That, and a commemorative set of bagpipes.",

All crawlers within the area of Cuba have been added to this quest. \nYour squad has been designated as host of this quest. \nOh, all right. For fuck\u2019s sake. I\u2019ve been debating on whether or not to allow this, but now that so many of you are hell bent on dying in such a spectacular manner, we might as well make it official. \nAmayon, one of the four princes of Sheol has been betrayed by one of his brothers. After being unceremoniously expelled from the kingdom of Sheol, the demon prince has managed to just barely hold on long enough to pull himself onto the equivalent of a very, very small ledge. The level 250 demon lord now inhabits the body of a lesser deity, a once-worshiped sea serpent who went by the name of the Madre de Aguas . \nIn order to return home, Amayon simply must cast a spell. But nobody, not even a prince, rides the river for free. A tithe of souls is required to pass back downward. And for a demon of his power, even as weak as he is right now, that tithe is pretty steep. \nSo he has cast his spell, a wide-area portal that will inhale all the souls within the Cuba area. This will be enough, barely, to send him home. \nUnfortunately for Amayon, his expulsion has not gone unnoticed. Other entities have noted that he is far from home, and they are doing what they can to keep him from returning. He is being thwarted. But even in his weakened state, he is still strong. He is still pushing the spell through. \nHere are your options. Option 1. Do nothing. \nReward : In two hours, the portal will cast, and all of the Cuba region will be sucked upward into the Sheol portal. This may or may not be a good thing depending on where you\u2019re standing when this happens. This portal will remain open for the remainder of this floor. Translation. Get the fuck out when you can. Option 2. Free Amayon from his shell. \nReward : This will cause Amayon to take his true form. The timer will reset, and this quest will reset into a World quest. We\u2019ve never had a full-powered, untethered hell prince unleashed on a lower floor before. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. Option 3. Kill Amayon. \nYeah, good luck with that, especially since he is invulnerable on this floor. \nReward : You will receive a Celestial Hell Boon.",

You can take your time with this one, but you ain\u2019t getting out until it\u2019s done. \nIsn\u2019t this a cute little town? It\u2019s just so quaint! Too bad the entire populace was turned into a gaggle of horrific, undead monsters who now want to devour your delicious souls. \nThis place used to be populated with a race of creature called a Ghommid. \nHave you ever looked through a microscope at a drop of seawater? It\u2019s really disturbing. There\u2019s all sorts of weird shit in there. Honestly, it gives me nightmares. \nAnyway, that\u2019s kinda what you get when you look at a Ghommid village. A \u201cGhommid\u201d is a sort of catch-all term for just your regular, run-of-the-mill other-realm creature. Visitors to this world from the land of the dead. There are all sorts, and many of them are one-of-a-kind. And like all those weird bugs and microbes in that drop of water, they do different things. Most are harmless. Some are cute. Some are angry. Some will give you explosive diarrhea just for fun. They often settle in areas where the veil is thin. Like cemeteries. \nThe problem with spirit creatures is that there really are all kinds. A settlement like this is bound to eventually implode. This was inevitable. \nIn this case, a spirit showed up, and for whatever reason turned everyone in the village into a ravenous, unsettled, I-want-to-turn-your-flesh-inside-out-and-party-with-your-intestines monster. \nYou must find and eradicate the source of the sickness. Removing it from the area will likely cure the populace. Or, who knows? Maybe they\u2019ll all go berserk and try to kill you even harder. I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m not nearly as omnipotent as those sadistic assholes think. Quarantine? They already know it doesn\u2019t work. Not when they want to keep their precious enhancement zones humming. They\u2019re in for a big surprise one of these days. \nReward : Well, you can leave the town. That\u2019s a good reward. Plus, the town will revert to a working settlement, and all the shops and structures will become activated again, assuming any of the workers are still alive. And why not?

Part one is called \u201cThe Big O.\u201d \nOnly those in the Cuba region may participate in part one. If they are successful, part two will initiate and will include everyone else. In the meantime, this upcoming battle will air on all screens throughout the dungeon for those outside the Cuba region. \nThe demon Amayon, prince of Sheol, is stuck in this world, banished here by one of his three brothers. \nYsalte, his former girlfriend and mother of his child, has also stepped into the realm, and she has seized control of the demon, just as he once seized her when she tried to flee their relationship. \nHe wants to go home. \nShe wants to keep him under her control and bring him with her to the Ascendency, where he will act as her retainer until the Ascendency battles are complete. While all the other gods have been waking up long-forgotten deities to assist them, the Vinegar Bitch knows having a prince of hell at her side will help ensure her claim to the throne. \nShe will return to the realm in ten minutes. If Amayon remains fully under her control when that timer is complete, they will both teleport away to the Ascendency. \nIf that happens, everyone without keys is dead. There will be no more chances. \nIn order to break free from Ysalte\u2019s grip, Amayon must begin the casting of his spell to return home. In order to do that, he must be strong enough to cast it. How will he be given strength? Maybe you should ask him. \nIf he has broken free from her control by the time the timer runs out, then she will leave, and he will remain and will eventually travel home. \nThe stronger he is by the time the timer runs out, the bigger the spell will have to be. If he is at full power, that spell will cover the entire world, and everyone within it will have hope to make it to the next floor. \nOh, and one last thing. \nThis is the eighth floor after all. \nClank, clank, clank, clank.",

Every season, the land crabs emerge from their forests to attend their sex parties in the oceans surrounding these lands.
