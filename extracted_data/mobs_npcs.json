That should tell you almost everything you need to know about these yappy little assholes. \nSmall, angry, think they are bigger than they really are, there is nothing more terrifying than a pack of these little bastards charging at you across the battlefield, at least in their own minds. But don\u2019t underestimate them, either. They are fearless, they are intelligent, and they bite first, ask questions later. \nTheir mounts, the Danger Dingoes, should probably worry you.",

We are so happy to have you here! \nLike the third floor, this sixth floor is a Dungeon Crawler World tradition! \nIt\u2019s the hunting grounds! This floor is almost identical in layout and size to the third floor, but the abandoned ruins have been claimed by hundreds of years of foliage. What secrets and mysteries lay hidden in the jungle? You\u2019ll have 17 days to find out! But this time, you won\u2019t be alone. \nWe currently have 360 hunters on deck, and they\u2019re raring to go. In a little less than 28 hours, they will be unleashed and will begin hunting you for your gear. Due to recent events, we are keeping registration open until the very last moment, and we expect that number of participants to double or even triple by the time they are released! But be warned! Some of these hunters have been here for weeks now, and even though they\u2019re currently sequestered, their minions and traps are still out there and waiting for you. A few of you have already found this out the hard way! \nTraditionally, all hunters start out at level 30 and are able to train themselves up as you make your way through the lower floors. It\u2019s no secret that you\u2019re here sooner than usual. In the spirit of fairness and as an incentive to gain more last-minute participants, we have given all hunters a bump of 20 levels, so they all start out at 50. \nWe\u2019ll have more information about the hunt after the next recap message, but I wanted to thank you all for your participation. I know that last floor was tough, and we did lose a few more crawlers than we anticipated. We will all have to work together to make sure your incompetence doesn\u2019t continue. \nThere are 2,344 exits leading to the seventh floor. There are multiple unguarded exits in the city of Zockau along with more in the valley beyond. In addition, some city boss and larger mobs will have an exit nearby. The rest are hidden, but should be easy to find. \nYour final sponsorship slots are now open to bidding. That\u2019s all for now. Now get out there and kill, kill, kill!",

Those of you who moved in to collect the dropped gear, please note that since this was an error on our part, the gear you obtained will be removed from your inventory immediately upon the end of this message. \nIn a related note, the lava tubes in that area are now also active, so keep that in mind if you want to play in that area. \nThe allosaurus mobs have been split into two distinct mob types to accommodate a newly-generated quest. In addition, for both mob types, the strength levels have been split further by gender. \nWe\u2019ve been forced to temporarily disable the Fuck those Trees in Particular spell as it didn\u2019t work as intended on this floor. \nFinally, we\u2019d like to announce a new feature. The preparations for the Butcher\u2019s Masquerade party are well underway. Several of you have expressed concern that you don\u2019t know where you stand in the rankings. Upon the end of this message, all crawlers will now be able to see their rankings if they are in the top 1,000. If you have nothing, that means you need to stop being so boring. \nThat\u2019s it for now. Now get out there and kill, kill, kill!",

    "description": "Per Syndicate rules, subsection 543 of the Precious Elemental Reserves Code, having failed to file a proper appeal for mineral and elemental rights within 50 Solars of first contact, your planet has been successfully seized and is currently being mined of all requested elemental deposits by the assigned planetary regent. \nEvery interior of your world has been crushed and all raw materials\u2014organic and inanimate\u2014are in the process of being mined for the requested elements. \nPer the Mined Material Reclamation act along with subsection 35 of the Indigenous Planetary Species Protection Act, any surviving humans will be given the opportunity to reclaim their lost matter. The Borant Corporation, having been assigned regency over this solar system, is allowed to choose the manner of this reclamation, and they have chosen option 3, also known as the 18-Level World Dungeon. The Borant Corporation retains all rights to broadcast, exploit, and otherwise control all aspects of the World Dungeon and will remain in control as long as they adhere to Syndicate regulations regarding world resource reclamation. \nUpon successful completion of level 18 of the World Dungeon, regency of this planet will revert to the successor. \nA Syndicate neutral observer AI\u2014myself\u2014has been created and dispatched to this planet to supervise the creation of the World Dungeon and to ensure all the rules and regulations are properly followed. \nPlease pay careful attention to the following information as it will not be repeated. \nPer the Indigenous Planetary Species Protection Act, all remaining materials\u2014estimated to be 99.999999% of the sifted matter\u2014is currently being repurposed for the subterranean World Dungeon. The first level of this dungeon will open approximately 18 seconds after the end of this announcement. The first-level entrances will be open for exactly one human hour and one hour only . Once the entrances are closed, you may no longer enter. If you enter, you may not leave until you have either completed all 18 levels of the World Dungeon or if you meet certain other requirements. \nIf you choose not to enter the World Dungeon, you will have to sustain yourself upon the surface of your planet, and this may be the last communication you receive during your lifetime. All previously-processed matter and elements are forfeit. However, you are free to mine and utilize any remaining and naturally-occurring resources for your own benefit. The Borant Corporation wishes you luck and thanks you for the opportunity. \nFor those who wish to exercise their right of resource reclamation, please take note. \nThere will be 150,000 level-one entrances added to the world. These entrances will be marked and easy to spot. If you so choose to enter the first level of the dungeon, you will have five rotations of your planet to find the next level down. There will be 75,000 entrances to level two. There will be 37,500 entrances to level three. 18,750 to level 4. 9,375 entrances to level 5 and 4,688 entrances to level 6. The number of available entrances to the next lower level will continue to decrease by half, rounding up until the 18th level, which will only have two entrances and a single exit. \nCrawlers who choose to enter the World Dungeon must find a staircase and descend to the next level down before the allotted time is up for that level. Once the time has passed, the level will be reclaimed and all remaining matter in the level, organic and inanimate, will be forfeit. Generated loot and other matter that is not gathered and claimed may be placed in the Syndicate market. \nEach lower level will have a longer period of reclamation. Additional rules come into play once any crawlers descend to the tenth floor. These rules will be explained when and if any crawlers reach this level. \nIf you so choose to enter the World Dungeon, it is highly recommended you immediately find and utilize a tutorial guild. Multiple tutorial guilds will be seeded throughout the dungeon on levels 1 through 3. \nIf you have any additional questions, or you wish to file an appeal, such requests must be submitted in writing directly to the closest Syndicate office. \nThank you for being a part of the Syndicate. Have a great day.",
