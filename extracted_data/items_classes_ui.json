    "description": "Former Child Actor \nThis rare subclass is an offshoot of the Character Actor class. It can only be obtained by Crawlers who have both received the \u201cCut!\u201d achievement and have obtained at least one trillion views. \nOnce a spoiled brat superstar, then addicted to drugs, you have crawled back from the brink stronger than ever. You are ready for your comeback. This Charisma and Chance-based class could go either way. You\u2019ll either rise to the top, or you\u2019ll be dead in a ditch in a week. \nThis unique Earth class is based on the Bard/Rogue Jack-Of-All-Trades subclass, but with a few distinctive differences. \nIn addition to the following benefits, the most distinct aspect of this multi-faceted class is the Level-3 Character Actor skill. This skill increases in level only upon descent to the next floor. \nAdditional benefits: \nImmunity to all poisons and diseases. \nLevel-5 Cockroach skill.` \n+10 to Charisma. \n+15% faster growth in all Charisma-based skills. \nThe Manager Benefit. \nThis is an Earth Class . As an incentive to choose an Earth Class, you will receive a Silver Earth Box upon choosing this class.",

    "description": "Bomb Squad Tech \nThis exclusive class is only available to crawlers who have obtained the Boom! Achievement. \nPeople who actually choose to work with explosives are the craziest bastards around. You excel at making things blow up. And while you\u2019re good at keeping the bombs from going off in your own hands, Bomb Squad Techs still tend to lose both friends and limbs at alarming rates. Luckily this class comes with a benefit that can fix 50% of that problem. \nAll explosive-based traps will mark themselves as you approach. All armor is 10% more effective. The handling of explosives no longer degrades them. Automatic +2 to all explosive-based skills. +5 Bomb Surgeon skill +2 to Dexterity. +2 to Constitution. -2 to Intelligence (After all, only dumbasses would choose to do this for a living.) \nPlus the Limb Regeneration Benefit. \nThis is an Earth Class. As an incentive to choose an Earth Class, you will receive a Silver Earth Box upon choosing this class.",

    "description": "Earth Hobby Potion. \nPer subsection 1256-C of the Indigenous Species Protection Act, this particular reward is required by the Syndicate Government to be awarded to all Crawlers who have chosen a domestic class. \nTaking this potion is optional, however it may not be sold or transferred to other Crawlers or entities. \nUpon drinking this, you will immediately obtain a Level Three skill ability in a unique, Earth-based hobby. The benefit is chosen at random, however you will not receive a skill that you currently have. \nGods, I hate it when the lawyers make me put their crap into the descriptions. Don\u2019t you? Anyway, this could be something useful like Parkour or Jui-jitsu, or you could get fucked and receive some useless crap like Stamp Collecting or Kombucha Brewing. Don\u2019t get your hopes up. The fact your planet was filled with so many boring assholes with inane, ridiculous hobbies tips the scales way out of your favor.",
