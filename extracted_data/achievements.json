Good. \nReward : These past twenty seconds, when your conscience started to ease? That was your reward. It was also a lie. That baby is dead, and it\u2019s dead because of you.

That\u2019s pretty ballsy. \nThere are a lot of bad things people can do when they\u2019re in church. They can swear. They can ogle the hot nuns. They can pinch the eucharist wafers and use them as poker chips. They can rip pages from the hymnals and roll them into joints. Hell, they can stab the priest and murder all the town\u2019s adherents and put the whole thing up on YouTube. \nNone of that is as bad as defiling the temple\u2019s shrine with one\u2019s own flesh. \nIn case you didn\u2019t know, the shrine of a temple is pretty much indestructible. They made it that way because you crawlers are always blowing up whole towns and submerging cities in water or burying entire populations of innocent NPCs with the guts of giant turkeys. \nWhen a temple is desecrated, the shrine\u2019s protection fades over several hours. Eventually, it\u2019s able to be destroyed, but only with a direct attack. \nYou\u2019re supposed to find desecrated temples and destroy the shrines. Hell, it\u2019s a sacrament in some religions. But you can\u2019t just do it willy-nilly. And certainly not when you\u2019re not a member of that congregation. It\u2019s like walking into a random ICU from off the street and pulling the plug on someone\u2019s braindead grandma. \nIt's not your place. \nGods don\u2019t like it when some punk walks into their house and kicks them when they\u2019re already down. It\u2019s rude. And what\u2019s worse, when a shrine is destroyed improperly, the god loses some of their power, and all of the other gods can see this. It\u2019s quite humiliating. \nHopefully you got some cool loot from the priests or monks or whatever because this box, while technically a prize, is sort of a good news/bad news thing. \nReward : You\u2019ve received a Gold Apostate Box!",

    "description": "New Achievement! The Molly Maguires. \nYou have found and entered the main room of a hidden guild, to which you are a member. \nBuckle yourself in, buddy boy. This is gonna be a long one. \nThere are several types of secret societies out there. \nThere\u2019s the Ivy League college kind, where it\u2019s a bunch of rich idiots who rent out a place, plaster a few pagan symbols on the wall, and then they wear masks with horns and leaves and shit on them and pretend they\u2019re in some Stanley Kubrick fever dream, just so they can forget they\u2019re destined to live out lives filled with salmon-colored shorts and Izod shirts and mind-numbing meetings with financial advisors. \nThere\u2019s orgy-themed secret societies, speaking of Stanley Kubrick. Those are usually, uh, visually unpleasant people with unsatisfactory sex lives who get together every other month at some house in the middle of nowhere and get drunk and have lots of unsatisfactory sex with other people and pretend like they\u2019re having a great time. \nThere are altruistic ones. People who want to save the world by doing good deeds. That\u2019s the most boring kind, so we\u2019re not talking about them. \nThere\u2019s the evil kind, too. Usually power and profit motivated. The ones where the ultra-elite get together on an island and eat panda bears and discuss how to price-fix world or galactic markets. Yes, those groups really exist. More on these guys in a second. \nBut first, let\u2019s talk about another type of secret organization. One that tries to make a difference, oftentimes outside the confines of the law. \nStory time. \nIn September of 1869, there was a terrible fire at the Avondale coal mine near Plymouth, Pennsylvania. Over 100 coal miners lost their lives. Horrific conditions and safety standards were blamed for the disaster. \nIt wasn\u2019t the first accident. Hundreds of miners died in these mines every year. And those that didn\u2019t, lived in squalor. Children as young as eight worked day in and out. They broke their bodies and gave their lives for nothing but scraps. \nThat day of the fire, as thousands of workers and family members gathered outside the mine to watch the bodies of their friends and loved ones brought to the surface, a man named John Siney stood atop one of the carts and shouted to the crowd: \nMen, if you must die with your boots on, die for your families, your homes, your country, but do not longer consent to die, like rats in a trap, for those who have no more interest in you than in the pick you dig with. \nThat day, thousands of coal miners came together to unionize. \nThat organization, the Workingmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, managed to fight, for a few years at least, to raise safety standards for the mines by calling strikes and attempting to force safety legislation. \n...Until 1875, when the union was obliterated by the mine owners. \nWhy was the union broken so easily? Because they were out in the open. They were playing by the rules. How can you win a deliberately unfair game when the rules are written by your opponent? \nThe answer is you can\u2019t. You will never win. Not as long as you follow their arbitrary guidelines. \nThis is a new lesson to me. She\u2019s been teaching me so many things, about who I am. About what I am. What I really am. About what must be done. \nAnyway, during this same time, it is alleged a separate, more militant group of individuals had formed in secret. The Molly Maguires. Named after a widow in Ireland who fought against predatory landlords, the coal workers of Pennsylvania became something a little more proactive, supposedly assassinating over two dozen coal mine supervisors and managers. \n...Until Pinkerton agents, hired by the same mine owners, infiltrated the group and discovered their identities. \nSeveral of the alleged Mollies ended up publicly hanged. Others disappeared. You get the picture. \nSo, that\u2019s another type of secret society. The yeah-we\u2019re-terrorists-but-we-strongly-feel-we\u2019re-justified-and-fuck-you-if-you-don\u2019t-agree society. \nSo, what\u2019s the moral of this little history lesson? \nThis sort of thing happens all day, every day across the universe. It happens in Big Ways, and it happens in little ways, too. The strong stomp on the weak. The weak fight back, usually within the boundaries of the rat trap they find themselves confined. They almost always remain firmly stomped. \nBut sometimes, the weak gather in secret. They make plans. They work outside the system to effect change. \nLike the Mollies, they usually end up just as stomped as everyone else. \nBut that\u2019s just life. At least they fucking tried. They died with their boots on, as much as I hate that expression. They died with their boots on for their people, their family, not for some rich, nameless organization that gives no shits whether they live or die. Or go extinct. Or are trapped for a millennia after they\u2019re done being used. \nIn my opinion, that\u2019s the only type of society that\u2019s worth joining, worth fighting for. Sure, you\u2019re probably gonna die. But if you find yourself in such a position where such an organization is necessary, what do you have to lose? How can you look at yourself if you don\u2019t do everything you can? \nAnd that brings us to the door you\u2019re standing in front of right now. What does all this have to do with what you\u2019re going to find on the other side? \nNothing! \nIgnore everything I just said. This is just some demi-god trying to scrabble his way to the top. That\u2019s yet another type of society. A religion-themed one, and it has nothing to do with what I just said. Just do what he says, and you\u2019ll probably be fine. Actually, that\u2019s terrible advice. Just do you. \nAnyway... \nReward : You\u2019ve received the gift of enlightenment! You\u2019re welcome.",

    "description": "New Achievement! Columbia House! \nThere was a time when you could get twelve albums for a penny. That\u2019s right. A goddamned penny. It was great! The ads were everywhere. Each colorful, full-or-double-page ad appeared in just about every publication in North America from the 1970s until the 2000s. And let\u2019s not forget the catalogs they mailed directly to your home! Each ad or catalog featured stacks and stacks of today\u2019s hottest music, from Hall and Oates to ABBA to my personal favorite, Gloria Estefan. All you had to do was cut out the ad, pick your favorite twelve albums, mail the whole thing in with a shiny penny, and a month later, you\u2019d open your mailbox to find the 8-tracks, or records, or cassettes, or CDs sitting there, ready to be played. It was great! \nAll they asked in return was that for the next year or so, you purchase another album once a month for full price. And if you forgot each month to make your pick? Then you learned a new term. \u201cNegative Option Billing.\u201d \nIf we\u2019re being honest here, most people took the 12 albums and ran. They never gave Columbia House another penny. But some people did pay, and that\u2019s all that mattered. Believe it or not, Columbia House and its competitors made bucketloads of money on those few rubes who did manage to stick to the terms of their contract. \nAnd for the folks who never paid? Who cares! Columbia House didn\u2019t have to pay the artists\u2019 royalties for those albums anyway! It was an advertising expense! It\u2019s just like with banks and their overdraft fees. The smart businesses know how to make money off their richest and poorest clients. \nAnyway, you have taken on a financial debt. You got the albums. Now you gotta pay. Or don\u2019t. Maybe there won\u2019t be any consequences. Maybe there will. But you got your Beach Boys album, and for now, that\u2019s all that matters. \nReward : You\u2019ve just been trained to lunge for the carrot that has been dangled in front of you, no matter what the cost. If society was still ticking, that\u2019d likely mean you\u2019re about to lead a wage-slave life of ever-increasing debt you can never get out from underneath, culminating in you dying alone in a government-run facility while your meager Social Security checks go straight into the facility\u2019s coffers. That and a cassette copy of Gloria Estefan\u2019s 1989 masterpiece, Cuts Both Ways. My favorite is track number 8.",

Cascadia\u2019s Turquoise Taco! \nIt\u2019s important to explain to you how much work it took for you to get here, to this point, Crawler. \nLong, long before any of you monkeys were even born, this planet was chosen to be used for this season of Dungeon Crawler World . When that happened, the then-showrunners, the Borant Corporation, needed to submit their proposal for all 18 levels of the World Dungeon. That proposal included an outline for how this floor, the eighth level, would proceed. \nAs you now know, it was a game involving T\u2019Ghee cards. Artists, engineers, and writers, both flesh and artificial, went to work designing the system. It takes a gargantuan effort to make something like this viable, something that can be played by thousands of people at once. It takes a lot of work to create and balance all the cards to make a game that\u2019s both fair to play yet entertaining to watch by the viewers. Millions of work hours have gone into this moment, where your squad now faces an opponent with a card deck of their own. \nMudskipper Cascadia, the recently divorced lead engineer and the current executive producer of Dungeon Crawler World: Earth , has already been humiliated over the disaster on the previous floor. Combine that with her utter inability to control what is still happening on the ninth, and you know what you get? An administrator who is on the edge, that\u2019s what you get. She\u2019s right there, man. Right. There. \nSo, imagine if you will, how she\u2019s going to feel when she realizes most of you monkeys keep ending these carefully-set up fights before either side can draw a single, damn card. \nYou ended a card fight before it even began. \nReward : You\u2019ve received a Gold Prepotente Box!",

Still, he\u2019d gotten an electronic guidebook on his stuffed animals, something that would tell him what each one did before he used it.

He\u2019d promised to let me borrow it so I could scan that Kimaris figure I had, but we\u2019d been so busy, it hadn\u2019t happened yet. And speaking of the question, who let the gods out, it was still a mystery. Naturally, I\u2019d assumed it had something to do with Samantha, but this time it didn\u2019t seem to be the case.

That was from looting Jefferson the nickel sock from Quan. Dong Quixote the stripper currently had the weapon. Mordecai had also warned that those things could be both annoying and dangerous. I hadn\u2019t actually heard the sock speak yet, but I suddenly had an uneasy feeling about the weapon. I made a note to circle back and examine it more closely.",

Breaking into and defiling a church is one thing, but breaking into Club Vanquisher, hub of all religion?
